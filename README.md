# Calculator

Made a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I made it with 4 functions. Function one was to add and update the display with the number that is being pressed.
I had to make a function that would hold the operator pressed and reset the numbers when adding more after the operator.
A functin to clear everything with the Clear button was pressed.
And the last one to give you the result depending what operator is being used.
